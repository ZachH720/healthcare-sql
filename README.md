### Description
A repository containing a dataset with healthcare information imported from kaggle.com to MySQL to run queries.
* I first modified the name column with the PROPER formula using Google Sheets. The original data had several typos.
* I decreased the decimal point to two places for the billing amount.
* Created a table in MySQL for the dataset to be imported into with an additional column for an auto-incremented ID.
* I performed several queries on the dataset to find information from the data.
